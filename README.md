# PhD thesis template for Computer Science Faculty of the University of Namur

## Description

This project contains a proposal for a template intended for PhD students writing their doctoral thesis in the 
Computer Science Faculty at the University of Namur.
This template is designed to be plug-and-play.
You only need to follow the instructions and write your content text.
All layout aspects are already set up.
The template is also well-commented to make its handling and understanding easy.
Finally, the template is accompanied by several layout examples (e.g., tables, listings, algorithms, SVG images, 
enumeration styles, glossary entry styles, hyphenations, etc.).

## Disclaimer

**DISCLAIMER!** Keep in mind that this version is a proposal.
This is not an official template that has to be used.
You can use your own template.

## Getting started

Basically, you have two main options:

* You can download the zip file of the source code and upload it on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) in a new 
  project.
* Alternatively, you can download the sources and set up your own LaTeX environment on your local host.

Once in the template source code, you can locate and follow the `% TODO` for replacing them with your content.

## Contribute

Contributions are welcome (e.g., bug reports, bug fixes, refactoring, examples, documentation, interesting package 
inclusions, etc.).

Please use the issues and pull request mechanisms.
