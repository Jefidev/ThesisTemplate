First, I would like to thank my supervisors, Prof. Pierre-Yves Schobbens and Prof. Patrick Heymans for their advice and help during the past six years. They have very different backgrounds and work in different research fields, which was very enriching for a young Ph.D. student. Being part of their research group was an incredible opportunity that gave me the chance to do lot of \textit{interesting things} (\textit{sic}) and meet a lot of different people.

I would like to offer my special thanks to Dr. Gilles Perrouin for his invaluable help all the way long. He is an incredible researcher and an endless source of ideas and advice on research and academic life as a Ph.D. student. Thank you Gilles for the guidance and numerous scientific (and non scientific) discussions!

I would also like to thank collaborators whose meeting contributed to develop this thesis: Dr. Mike Papadakis who introduced us to mutation testing and to whom, after this last months spent writing, I will be able to answer \textit{yes} to the question \textit{everything good?}; Dr. Axel Legay for his help on the formal aspects of FTSs, statistical testing, and automata language equivalence; Dr. Maxime Cordy for his expertise on FTSs and model checking; and Dr. Benoit Baudry for accepting being part of the thesis support committee and for the valuable comments after the mid-term test. All my thanks to the members of the jury for the time spent reading this manuscript and for the feedbacks: Dr. Benoit Baudry, Prof. Myra B. Cohen, Prof. Vincent Englebert, Dr. Axel Legay, and Dr. Gilles Perrouin.

Special thanks to my colleagues Beno\^it V. for the (numerous) chats and debates contributing to make every coffee break unique\footnote{$\ldots$ and for the logo!}, Aude N. for the everlasting good mood and being a geek amongst geeks, Catherine for the pep talks and the enthusiasm each time we come up with a new idea, Julian \aka best sysadmin ever, Anthony S. for the (long-overdue) bunker sheltering, Moussa who accepted to step into the \textit{compiler project renewal}, Hajer and Nesrine, Cédric and Pierre-Antoine, Saria, Abdel, Fabian and Nicolas, Maxime and Loup, Julie, Tony, Adrien, James, Beno\^it F., Eleonora, and all the other players of the Friday lunch break, for the all good times spent together and contribution to make the Computer Science Faculty a great place to work. 

Thank you Mathieu, Jeremy, Thomas, Axel, and Alexandre for accepting to collaborate with us and the good work that contributed to the research presented in this thesis. Thank you Maxime, Geoffroy, Guillaume, and all the students I have had the pleasure to work with, for the fun and not complaining too much about the (sometimes crazy) teaching assistant I may have been during the past 6 years.

To my longtime friends: thank you Steven, Aude, Marie, François, Laurent, Stéfanie, Aurore, Ariane, and Vincent for your friendship and support during all those years, and the many years to come.
